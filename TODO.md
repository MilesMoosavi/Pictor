> **⚠️ PRIORITY**: This TODO file must ALWAYS be updated whenever changes are made to the codebase. It serves as the single source of truth for what needs to be worked on next. Do not track completed tasks here - only document remaining work and next steps.
> **NOTE**: After each commit, reset this file to only the current actionable TODO items. Remove completed, historical, and archived sections to keep the file focused and maintainable.
